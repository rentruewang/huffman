A kotlin implementation of huffman-encoding.

Kotlin, based on Java, is much faster than Python is, while having Python's readability IMO.

Its type checks are nothing short of amazing!

It's weird, though, that VSCode and GitHub can't get the Kotlin coloring right. Works fine with xed (linux mint's replacement for gedit).
