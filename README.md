# huffman-encoding
An efficient encoding method.

Huffman encoding has proven to be a brilliant method to encode,

providing an upper bound to the compressed file, just one character above entropy.

And an lower bound, of course, of entropy itself.

It seems that VSCode and GitHub can't get the coloring of a Kotlin file right...
What a shame.
