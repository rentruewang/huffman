# huffman-encoding
### An efficient encoding method.

Huffman encoding has proven, and is proved, to be a brilliant method to encode,

providing an upper bound to the compressed file, just _one character_ above **entropy**.

And an lower bound, of course, of **entropy** itself.

It seems that VSCode and GitHub can't get the coloring of a Kotlin file right...
What a shame.
